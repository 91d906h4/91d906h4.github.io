## Introduction

DMitry is a powerful open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool that aids in gathering and analyzing information about a target. It is designed to provide valuable insights by querying different sources and collecting data such as IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and more.

DMitry automates the process of information gathering and performs tasks like DNS enumeration, port scanning, and whois lookups, enabling users to gather comprehensive information about a target entity.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

By default, DMitry will run all the functions below:

1. whois lookup
2. Gather information from Netcraft.com
3. Gather subdomain information
4. Gather e-mail information
5. TCP port scan

But it's not recommended to run the TCP port scan with DMitry, so the better way is to specify all the functions except the TCP port scan with command `dmitry -iwnse`. 

```sh
dmitry example.com
```

### TCP Port Scan (Not Recommended)

```sh
dmitry -p example.com
```

If you want to list the results of all ports (incluude the filtered ports), use option `-f`.

```sh
dmitry -p -f example.com
```

```
HostIP:93.184.216.34
HostName:example.com

4/tcp           filtered
5/tcp           filtered
...
```

And you can use option `-t` to set the Time To Live (TTL) of the portscan module (the default TTL is 2).

```sh
dmitry -p -t 1 example.com

### Configuration Options

```
NAME
    DMitry - deepmagic information gathering tool

SYNOPSIS
    dmitry [options] host

DESCRIPTION
    host
        The hostname.

OPTIONS
    -o filename
        Create  an ascii text output of the results to the filename specified. If no output filename is specified then output will be saved to "target.txt". If this option is not specified in any form output will be sent to the standard output (STDOUT) by default. This option MUST trail all other options, i.e. "dmitry -winseo target".

    -i
        Perform an Internet Number whois lookup on the target IP address.

    -w
        Perform a whois lookup on the host target.

    -n
        Retrieve netcraft.com data concerning the host, this includes operating system, web server release and uptime information where available.

    -s
        Perform a subdomain search on the specified target. This will use serveral search engines to attempt to locate subdomains in the form of sub.target. There is no set limit to the level of subdomain  that can be located, however, there is a maximum string length of 40 characters (NCOL 40) to limit memory usage.  Possible subdomains are then reversed to an IP address, if this comes back positive then the resulting subdomain is listed. However, if the host uses an asterisk in their DNS records all resolve subdomains will come back positive.

    -e
        Perform an e-mail address search on the specified target. This modules works using the same concept as the subdomain search by attempting to locate possible e-mail addresses for a target host. The  e-mail addresses may also be for possible subdomains of the target host. There is a limit to the length of the e-mail address set to 50 characters (NCOL 50) to limit memory usage.

    -p
        Perform a TCP portscan on the host target. This module will list open, closed and filtered ports within a specific range.

    -f
        This option will cause the TCP portscan module to report/display output of filtered ports. These are usually ports that have been filtered and/or closed by a firewall at the  specified host/target. This option requires that the '-p' option be passed as a previous option. For example, "dmitry -pf target".

    -b
        This option will cause the TCP portscan module to output banners if they are received when scanning TCP ports. This option requires that the '-p' option be passed as a previous option.For example, "dmitry -pb target".

    -t
        This sets the Time To Live (TTL) of the portscan module when scanning individual ports. This is set to 2 seconds by default. This is usually required when scanning a host that has a firewall and/or has filtered ports which can slow down a scan.
