## Introduction

I "invented" this sorting algorithm during the class. I was studying about algorithm at that time, and looking for "my own sorting algorithm".

This sorting algorithm is not so efficient, it takes O(n^2) time to sort an array. But for me, it means a lot.

And after some research, I found a sorting algorithm that is very similar to Mountain Sort, that is [Strand Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand_sort). it use the similar strategy to sort an array. I think, I was late.

Here is my [manuscript](https://github.com/91d906h4/Mountain-Sort/blob/main/manuscript.pdf).

Here's how Mountain Sort works if we scan the array from left to right once. (In fact, this is the visualization of Strand Sort, they are almostly the same.)

## Time Complexity

It takes O(n) time to scan the array from left to right and from right to left, and it scans the array again and again untill all the elements in the array are sorted.

- In the worst case, we'll need scan the array in O(n) time n / 2 times (we choose 2 elements in 1 scan), so the time complexity will be O(n^2).
- In the average case, we also need O(n^2) time to sort the array.
- In the best case, we only need to scan the array 1 time, the time complexity is O(n).

## Performance

As we can see, the performance of Mountaint Sort is much better than Insertion Sort. We can reasonably guess that the time complexity of Mountain Sort is lower than O(n^2) in average case.

## Code

```py
def merge(arr1: list, arr2: list) -> list:
    l1, l2 = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    p1, p2 = 0, 0
    result = []
    
    while p1 < l1 and p2 < l2:
        if arr1[p1] < arr2[p2]:
            result.append(arr1[p1])
            p1 += 1
        else:
            result.append(arr2[p2])
            p2 += 1
    
    result = result + arr1[p1:] + arr2[p2:]

    return result

def mountainSort(array: list) -> list:
    length = len(array) # Get the length of array.
    counter = 0 # Check how many elements are found. If all elements are found, then return the result.
    result = [] # The result of sorted array.
    recorder = {} # Check if element is found.

    while counter < length:
        left, l = [], float("-inf")
        right, r = [], float("-inf")

        for i in range(length):
            if i not in recorder and array[i] > l:
                l = array[i]
                left.append(l)
                recorder[i] = 1
                counter += 1

            if length - i - 1 not in recorder and array[length - i - 1] > r:
                r = array[length - i - 1]
                right.append(r)
                recorder[length - i - 1] = 1
                counter += 1

        result = merge(result, merge(left, right))

    return result
```
