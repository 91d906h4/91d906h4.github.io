## Introduction

Crunch is a free, open-source tool used for generating custom wordlists that can be used in password cracking attacks. It is commonly used in penetration testing and security audits to test the strength of password policies and authentication mechanisms. The tool allows users to generate wordlists with custom character sets, lengths, and patterns to match specific password requirements.

Crunch can generate wordlists containing any combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Users can specify the minimum and maximum length of passwords, as well as specific patterns that the passwords must follow, such as requiring the first letter to be uppercase or including a specific set of characters.

One of the key features of Crunch is its ability to generate large wordlists quickly. This is important in password cracking attacks where a large number of passwords need to be tested. Additionally, Crunch supports multithreading, which can further increase its speed.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To generate all the combination of chars "abc123" with minimal length 1 and maximal length 5, you can just use the follwing command.

Notice that the order must be lower case characters, upper case characters, numbers, and then symbols.

```sh
crunch 1 3 abc123
```

```sh
a
b
...
c3a
...
332
333
```

If you want to generate passwords with space character, you must enclose your characters set in quotes.

```sh
crunch 3 3 "abc123 "
```

```sh
aaa
aab
...
3 a 
...
  3

```

### Exclude Duplicate Characters

This will give a limit on the number of characters that can occur together.

```sh
crunch 3 3 abc123 -d 2@
```

```sh
aab
aac
...
cca
...
331
332
```

"aaa" will not be generated because there are 3 duplicate characters (> 2) in string "aaa".

### Start and End of List

You can use option `-s` and `-e` to specify where the password list should start and end.

```sh
crunch 3 3 123456 -s 222 -e 333
```

```sh
222
223
...
321
...
332
333
```

### Reversed List

With the option `-i` enabled, Crunch will reverse all of the passwords in the list.

```sh
crunch 3 3 abcde -i
```

```sh
aaa
baa
...
beb
...
dee
eee
```

### Password with specified Format

There 4 special characters in Crunch:

```
@ will insert lower case characters
, will insert upper case characters
% will insert numbers
^ will insert symbols
```

```sh
crunch 3 3 -t passw,rd%
```

```sh
passwArd0
passwArd1
...
passwErd5
...
passwZrd8
passwZrd9
```

### Password with @,%^

In Crunch, the characters `@`, `,`, `%`, and `^` have special meaning. If you want to generate passwords with these characters, you can use the option `-t` with `-l` (The length of `-l` must be equal to `-t`).

The format of the parameter of option `-l`:

1. If you want Crunch to parse the special character (`@`, `,`, `%`, and `^`) by default, then put `a`.
2. If you want Crunch to parse the character as how it looks like, then put `@`, `,`, `%`, or `^`.

```sh
crunch 3 3 -t Z@%^ -l a@a^
```

```sh
Z@0^
Z@1^
...
Z@5^
...
Z@8^
Z@9^
```

For more example:

```sh
crunch 3 3 -t Z@%^ -l a@aa
```

```sh
Z@0!
Z@0@
...
Z@5=
...
Z@9/
Z@9 
```

### Combination of Words

```sh
crunch 1 1 -p abc zxc 123
```

```sh
123abczxc
123zxcabc
abc123zxc
abczxc123
zxc123abc
zxcabc123
```

### Words in File

list.txt:

```
abc
zxc
123
```

```sh
crunch 1 1 -q list.txt
```

```sh
123abczxc
123zxcabc
abc123zxc
abczxc123
zxc123abc
zxcabc123
```

### Output to File

```sh
crunch 3 3 -o password.txt -p 123
```

password.txt:

```
123
132
213
231
312
321
```

If the parameter of `-o` is `START`, Crunch will automatically generate the filename.

```sh
crunch 3 3 -o START -p 123
```

123-321.txt:

```
123
132
213
231
312
321
```

## Details

### Configuration Options

```
NAME
    crunch - generate wordlists from a character set

SYNOPSIS
    crunch <min-len> <max-len> [<charset string>] [options]

DESCRIPTION
    min-len
        The minimum length string you want crunch to start at.

    max-len
        The  maximum length string you want crunch to end at.

    charset string
        The character sets for crunch to use, if you leave it blank crunch will use the default character sets.

OPTIONS
    -b number[type]
        Specifies the size of the output file, valid values for type are kb, mb, gb, kib, mib, and gib. There is no space between the number and type, for example, 500kib is correct while 500 kib is not. Only works if -o START is used.

    -c number
        Specifies the number of lines to write to output file. Only works if -o START is used.

    -d numbersymbol
        Limits the number of duplicate characters. For example, -d 2@ limits the lower case alphabet to output like "aab" and "aac". "aaa" would not be generated as that is 3 (> 2) consecutive letters of a.

    -e string
        Specifies when crunch should stop early.
    
    -f charset.lst charset-name
        Specifies a character set from the charset.lst. [1]

    -i
        Inverts the output so instead of aaa,aab,aac,aad, etc you get aaa,baa,caa,daa,aba,bba, etc

    -l
        When you use the -t option this option tells crunch which symbols should be treated as literals. This will allow you to use the placeholders as letters in the pattern. The -l option should be the same length as the -t option.

    -o filename
        Specifies the file to write the output to.

    -p word1 word2 ...
        Generate to combinations of word1, word2, ... . With this option, crunch will ignore min and max length (still required).

    -p word
        Tells crunch to generate words that don't have repeating characters.

    -q filename
        Tells  crunch to read filename and permute what is read. This is like the -p option except it gets the input from filename.

    -s startblock
        Specifies a starting string.

    -t @,%^
        Specifies a pattern, where the only the @'s, ,'s, %'s, and ^'s will change.
        @ will insert lower case characters
        , will insert upper case characters
        % will insert numbers
        ^ will insert symbols

    -u
        The -u option disables the printpercentage thread.  This should be the last option.

    -z gzip, bzip2, lzma, and 7z
        Compresses the output from the -o option.
```


[1] The format of charset.lst must be like:

```
# The comment of charset

charset_name_1 = [0123456789]
charset_name_2 = [abcde0123456789]
charset_name_3 = [abcde123456!@#$%^]
...
```
