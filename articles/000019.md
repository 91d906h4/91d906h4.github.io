## Introduction

WAFW00F is a powerful and widely used security tool designed to identify and fingerprint web application firewalls (WAFs). It helps security professionals and penetration testers determine if a website or web application is protected by a WAF and provides insights into the type of WAF being used.

By analyzing the responses received from the target server, WAFW00F can detect the presence of common WAFs such as ModSecurity, Cloudflare, and Sucuri, among others. This information is valuable for assessing the security posture of a web application and planning appropriate security testing or attack strategies.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```sh
wafw00f example.com
```

```
[*] Checking https://example.com
[+] The site https://example.com is behind Edgecast (Verizon Digital Media) WAF.
[~] Number of requests: 2
```

### Find All WAFs

There might be multiple WAFs before the server, if you want to find other WAFs, use option `-a`.

```sh
wafw00f example.com -a
```

```
[*] Checking https://example.com
[+] The site https://example.com is behind Edgecast (Verizon Digital Media) WAF.
[+] Generic Detection results:
[*] The site https://example.com seems to be behind a WAF or some sort of security solution
[~] Reason: The server header is different when an attack is detected.
The server header for a normal response is "ECS (oxr/830C)", while the server header a response to an attack is "ECS (oxr/8316)",
[~] Number of requests: 7
```

### Specified WAF

Use option `-t` to test specific WAFs.

```sh
wafw00f example.com -t "ACE XML Gateway (Cisco)"
```

Use option `-l` to see the available WAFs.

```sh
wafw00f example.com -l
```

```
WAF Name                        Manufacturer
--------                        ------------
ACE XML Gateway                  Cisco
aeSecure                         aeSecure
...
Zenedge                          Zenedge
ZScaler                          Accenture
Shieldon Firewall                Shieldon.io
```

### No Redirect

Use option `-r` to tell WAFW00F do not follow the 3xx redirect responses.

```sh
wafw00f example.com -r
```
