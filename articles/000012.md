## Introduction

Slowloris is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack tool. It is designed to take advantage of a weakness in web servers that allows for slow connections by keeping the connection open as long as possible. The tool does this by initiating multiple connections to the target server and then sending HTTP headers very slowly, which can overwhelm the server's capacity to handle new connections.

Slowloris works by sending partial HTTP requests, leaving the request open and keeping the server waiting for the complete request. The tool can also keep multiple connections open simultaneously, thus further adding to the server's workload. By consuming server resources with idle connections, Slowloris can cause a server to become unresponsive or crash.

Slowloris is particularly effective against servers that have a limited number of resources available, such as those with low bandwidth or connections. The tool is also difficult to detect and prevent since it mimics legitimate traffic and does not require a large number of connections to be effective.

## Attack Process

1. The attacker sends partial HTTP requests to the target server, but doesn't complete them.

2. The target server creates a new thread for each incoming request, but since the requests are never completed, these threads stay open.

3. The attacker keeps sending partial HTTP requests to the target server at regular intervals to keep the threads open.

4. As the number of open threads increases, the target server becomes overloaded and can't handle new requests from legitimate users.

5. Eventually, the target server becomes unresponsive and denies service to all users.

6. The attack continues until the attacker stops sending the partial HTTP requests, or until the target server crashes or is taken down.

## Prevention

Accroding to IBM's documents, there are two recommended ways to prevent Slowloris Attack:

1. Use a hardware load balancer that accepts only complete HTTP connections and only forwards complete HTTP requests to the web server.

2. To set timeouts for receiving the HTTP request headers and the HTTP request body from a client.

## Usage

In this section, we will introduce some common usage Slowloris.

### Basic Usage

```sh
python slowloris.py example.com
```

### With Specified Port

The default port number is 80, you can use option `-p` or `--port` to specify the port to attack.

```sh
python slowloris.py -p 8080 example.com
```

### With Specified Sleeptime

The default sleeptime is 15, you can use option `--sleeptime` to change the sleeptime between each header sent (notice that the sleeptime sould not be to short, or the attack may be detected by the firewall).

```sh
python slowloris.py --sleeptime 1 example.com
```

### 

## Demonstration

The demonstration shows that we used this tool to attack a local PHP built-in server. We can see there are more and more incomplete requests are sent to server and the threads are opened and remain open.
