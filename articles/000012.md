## Introduction

Slowloris is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack tool. It is designed to take advantage of a weakness in web servers that allows for slow connections by keeping the connection open as long as possible. The tool does this by initiating multiple connections to the target server and then sending HTTP headers very slowly, which can overwhelm the server's capacity to handle new connections.

Slowloris works by sending partial HTTP requests, leaving the request open and keeping the server waiting for the complete request. The tool can also keep multiple connections open simultaneously, thus further adding to the server's workload. By consuming server resources with idle connections, Slowloris can cause a server to become unresponsive or crash.

Slowloris is particularly effective against servers that have a limited number of resources available, such as those with low bandwidth or connections. The tool is also difficult to detect and prevent since it mimics legitimate traffic and does not require a large number of connections to be effective.

## Usage

In this section, we will introduce some common usage Slowloris.

### Basic Usage

```sh
python slowloris.py example.com
```

### With Specified Port

The default port number is 80, you can use option `-p` or `--port` to specify the port to attack.

```sh
python slowloris.py -p 8080 example.com
```

### With Specified Sleeptime

The default sleeptime is 15, you can use option `--sleeptime` to change the sleeptime between each header sent (notice that the sleeptime sould not be to short, or the attack may be detected by the firewall).

```sh
python slowloris.py --sleeptime 1 example.com
```

### Show More Log Info

Use option `-v` or `--verbose` to print more information on the terminal.

```sh
python slowloris.py -v example.com
```

### Send Request With Built-In User Agent

Use option `-ua` or `--user-agent` to randomize the user agent of each request.

```sh
python slowloris.py -ua example.com
```

## Demonstration

The demonstration shows that we used this tool to attack a local PHP built-in server. We can see there are more and more incomplete requests are sent to server and the threads are opened and remain open.
