## Introduction

GNU MAC Changer is a versatile command-line tool designed for Linux-based systems that enables users to modify or spoof the MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of network interfaces. By changing the MAC address, users can enhance privacy and security by masking their network identity and impersonating other devices on a network.

GNU MAC Changer offers features such as random MAC address generation, vendor-specific address emulation, interface selection, persistent changes, and an automated mode for periodic MAC address alteration. With its easy-to-use command-line interface, GNU MAC Changer provides users with a flexible and efficient solution for manipulating MAC addresses in a controlled and customizable manner.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```sh
macchanger -m 56:d3:85:a0:9d:c7 eth0
```

```
Current MAC:   c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
Permanent MAC: c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
New MAC:       56:d3:85:a0:9d:c7 (unknown)
```

### Show MAC

```sh
macchanger -s eth0
```

```
Current MAC:   56:d3:85:a0:9d:c7 (unknown)
Permanent MAC: c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
```

### Random MAC

```sh
macchanger -r eth0
```

```
Current MAC:   32:1b:74:29:b3:2d (unknown)
Permanent MAC: c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
New MAC:       66:d2:0e:34:92:1e (unknown)
```

Or you can use option `-a` to set random vendor MAC of the same kind; use option `-A` to set random vendor MAC of any kind.

```sh
macchanger -a eth0
```

```sh
macchanger -A eth0
```

If you don't want to change the MAC vendor, use option `-e` to keep the vendor bytes.

```sh
macchanger -e eth0
```

### Reset MAC

```sh
macchanger -p eth0
```

```
Current MAC:   66:d2:0e:34:92:1e (unknown)
Permanent MAC: c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
New MAC:       c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
```

### List Vendors

Today, there are about 6200 vendors.

```sh
macchanger -l
```

```
...
0035 - 00:a0:f8 - Symbol Spectrum24
0036 - 00:0c:f1 - Intel Pro 2100
0037 - 00:e0:29 - OEM OEM
0038 - 08:00:0e - Old Lucent Wavelan
0039 - 08:00:46 - Sony PCWA-C10
```

### Burned-In MAC Address

The option `-b` can only be used with `-r`.

> A burned-in MAC address, also known as a hardware or physical address, refers to the unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) or network adapter by the manufacturer. It is permanently embedded in the network hardware during the manufacturing process and cannot be easily changed or modified.

```sh
macchanger -r -b eth0
```

```
Current MAC:   80:31:67:8f:db:a2 (unknown)
Permanent MAC: c6:46:76:2f:85:a2 (unknown)
New MAC:       98:ba:77:28:57:02 (unknown)
```

    -s, --show
        Prints the current MAC. This is the default action when no other option is specified.

    -e, --ending
        Don't change the vendor bytes.

    -a, --another
        Set random vendor MAC of the same kind.

    -A
        Set random vendor MAC of any kind.

    -r, --random
        Set fully random MAC.

    -p, --permanent
        Reset MAC address to its original, permanent hardware value.

    -l, --list[=keyword]
        Print known vendors (with keyword in the vendor's description string).

    -b, --bia
        When setting fully random MAC pretend to be a burned-in-address. If not used, the MAC will have the locally-administered bit set.

    -m, --mac XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, --mac=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
