## Introduction

Sherlock is a versatile open-source tool in Kali Linux that aids in the investigation of social media accounts across various platforms. It allows users to search for a specific username or handle and collect relevant information associated with that account, such as profiles, posts, and other publicly available data.

Sherlock simplifies the process of gathering intelligence from popular social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more, by automating the search and retrieval of user information. With its easy-to-use command-line interface and extensive coverage of social media platforms, Sherlock serves as a valuable asset for digital forensics, OSINT investigations, and reconnaissance activities, providing users with a consolidated view of an individual's online presence across multiple platforms.
