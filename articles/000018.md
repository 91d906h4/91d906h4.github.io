## Introduction

netdiscover is a network scanning tool that allows users to discover active hosts and gather information about the connected devices on a local network. It operates by sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests and analyzing the responses to identify live hosts, their MAC addresses, and associated IP addresses. netdiscover provides a simple command-line interface and offers features like passive listening, active scanning, vendor identification, and customizable output formats.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```sh
netdiscover
```

```
Currently scanning: 192.168.6.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

1 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 1 hosts.   Total size: 42
_____________________________________________________________________________
IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
172.19.80.1   c2:6a:6a:03:37:a5      1      42  unknown
```

### Specified Interface

```sh
netdiscover -i eth0
```

### Specified CIDR

The acceptable CIDR are /8, /16, and /24.

```sh
netdiscover -r 192.168.0.0/24
```

Or you can use option `-l` to specify the ranges with file.

ranges.txt:

```
192.168.21.0/24
172.26.0.0/16
10.0.0.0/8
```

```sh
netdiscover -l ranges.txt
```

netdiscover will scan the range `192.168.21.0/24`, `172.26.0.0/16`, and `10.0.0.0/8`.

### Passive Mode

If you don't want to suspected by others, you can use option `-p` to enable passive mode (with this options enabled, netdiscover will not send anything).

```sh
netdiscover -p
```

### Scan for Known MAC Address

Use option `-m` to specify the MAC addresses scan.

list.txt:

```
7e:89:c4:94:2c:6e
be:b4:f0:0c:fe:98
ba:9d:7c:ba:e4:32
```

```sh
netdiscover -m list.txt
```

### Sleep Between Each Request

Use option `-s` to sleep n milliseconds between each ARP request send.

```sh
netdiscover -s 100
```

### Send Multiple Times

If the network is unstable, you can set the option `-c` to send ARP requests in multiple times to prevent packet loss.

```sh
netdiscover -c 2
```

### Fast Mode

With the option `-f` enabled, netdiscover will only scan the addresses .1, .100 and .254 on each network.

```sh
netdiscover -f
```

### Configuration Options

```
NAME
    netdiscover - active/passive ARP reconnaissance tool

SYNOPSIS
    netdiscover [options]

OPTIONS
    -i device
        The network interface to sniff and inject packets. If no interface  specified, first available will be used.

    -r range
        Scan a given range instead of auto scan. Valid range values area for example: 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/8. Currently, acceptable ranges are /8, /16 and /24 only.

    -l file
        Scan ranges contained on the given file. It must contain only one range per line.

    -p
        Enable passive mode. In passive mode, netdiscover does not send anything, but does only sniff.

    -m file
        Scan a list of known MACs and hostnames.

    -F filter
        Customize pcap filter expression (default: "arp").

    -s time
        Sleep given time in milliseconds between each ARP request injection (default 1).

    -c count
        Number of times to send each ARP request. Useful for networks with packet loss, so it will scan given times for each host (default 1).

    -n node
        Last IP octet of the source IP used for scanning. You can change it if the default host (x.x.x.67) is already used (allowed range is 2 to 253, default 67).

    -d
        Ignore configuration files at home dir (for autoscan and fast mode only). This will use default ranges and IPs for autoscan and fast mode.

    -f
        Enable fast mode scan. This will only scan for .1, .100 and .254 on each network. This mode is useful while searching for ranges being used. After you found such range you can make a specific range scan to find online boxes.

    -P
        Produces an output suitable to be redirected into a file or to be parsed by another program, instead of using interactive mode. Enabling this option, netdiscover will stop after scanning given ranges.

    -L
        Similar to -P but continue program execution to capture ARP packets passively after the active scan. phase to capture ARP packets passively.

    -N
        Do not print header. Only valid when -P or -L is enabled.

    -S
        (DEPRECATED) Enable sleep time suppression between each request. If set, netdiscover will sleep after having scanned 255 hosts instead of sleeping after each one. This mode was used in netdiscover 0.3 beta4 and before. Avoid this option in networks with packet loss, or in wireless networks with low signal level (also called hardcore mode).
