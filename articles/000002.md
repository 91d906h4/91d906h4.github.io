## Introduction

In this article, I will provide a way to host you own hidden service.

<!-------------------->

## Download the Tor Browser

First of all, you need to download the Tor Browser. (Of cource, there're ways to host a hidden service without Tor Browser, but here we will host our dark web with it.)

Here's the link to Tor Project:<br />

<!-------------------->

## Specify the "HiddenServiceDir"

Under the folder `\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor`, there's a file without extension named `torrc`. The content of `torrc` will look like this:

```
# This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be preserved
# The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1, and Tor will ignore it

ClientOnionAuthDir C:\Program Files\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor\onion-auth
DataDirectory C:\Program Files\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor
GeoIPFile C:\Program Files\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor\geoip
GeoIPv6File C:\Program Files\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor\geoip6
```

Add the following lines under the `torrc` file.

```
HiddenServiceDir <hidden_service_dir_name>
HiddenServicePort <port> <host>:<port>
```

<ul>
    <li>&#60;hidden_service_dir_namet&#62; means where to store your hidden service address and private key. (If the folder is empty, the Tor Browser will generator a random addresss and private key.

    <li>&#60;port&#62; and &#60;host&#62; means where do you host your hidden service. (On Windows, &#60;host&#62; usually be 127.0.0.1.)</li>
</ul>

<!-------------------->

## Start your hidden service

Just like to host a website on clearnet, all you will need to do is to start a local web server. (The host and port must be same as what you specified on the previous step.)

In the step 2, if your <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> were empty, the Tor Browser would generate a addresss randomly.<br />
If you want to host a hidden service with your own vanity address, you can use the vanity address generator <code>mkp224o</code>.

First, download the latest version of <code>mkp224o</code> from GitHub and unzip it.<br />
Here is the releases : <a href="https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o/releases</a>

Then run the following command under the unziped folder.

```
.\mkp224o.exe <vanity_address_prefix>
```

<ul>
    <li>The &#60;vanity_address_prefix&#62; means the prefix of the vanity address you want.</li>
</ul>
