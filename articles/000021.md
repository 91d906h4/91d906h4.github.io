## Introduction

Hydra is a powerful and versatile online password cracking tool that specializes in performing brute force and dictionary-based attacks on various protocols and services. Hydra supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, SMTP, and many others, making it a comprehensive tool for testing different authentication mechanisms.

With its ability to perform rapid and automated password guessing, Hydra can efficiently test large password lists against target systems. It offers flexibility in specifying attack parameters, such as username lists, password dictionaries, and concurrent connections, allowing users to customize the attack scenarios.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Use option `-l` to specify a username to try, and use option `-p` to specify a password to try.

You must to specify the server and the service, the available services are: `adam6500`, `afp`, `asterisk`, `cisco`, `cisco-enable`, `cvs`, `firebird`, `ftp`, `ftps`, `http[s]-{head|get|post}`, `http[s]-{get|post}-form`, `http-proxy`, `http-proxy-urlenum`, `icq`, `imap[s]`, `irc`, `ldap2[s]`, `ldap3[-{cram|digest}md5][s]`, `mssql`, `mysql(v4)`, `mysql5`, `ncp`, `nntp`, `oracle`, `oracle-listener`, `oracle-sid`, `pcanywhere pcnfs pop3[s]`, `postgres`, `rdp`, `radmin2`, `redis`, `rexec`, `rlogin`, `rpcap`, `rsh`, `rtsp`, `s7-300`, `sapr3`, `sip`, `smb`, `smtp[s]`, `smtp-enum`, `snmp`, `socks5`, `ssh`, `sshkey`, `svn`, `teamspeak`, `telnet[s]`, `vmauthd`, `vnc`, `xmpp`.

```sh
hydra -l username -p password example.com ftp
```

```

### Batch Username / Password

Use option `-L` and `-P` to specify the files with usernames and passwords to try.

users.txt:

```
admin
user1
john
...
```

pws.txt:

```
admin
password
ilovecode
...
```

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -P pws.txt example.com ftp
```

Or you can put the usernames and passwords in the same file with format `username:password`, and use option `-C`.

user-pws.txt

```
admin:admin
user1:password
john:ilovecode
```

```sh
hydra -C user-pws.txt example.com ftp
```

### Built-In Password Generator

If you didn't have a password list, you can use the built-in option `-x` to generate a one, and the format is `min:max:charset`.

In the `charset` section, `a` means lowercase; `A` means uppercase; `1` means numbers.

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -x 3:6:aA1 example.com ftp
```

If you want to generate password list with specified characters, use option `-y` with `-x`.

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -x 3:6:cde789 -y example.com ftp
```

### Connect With SSL

Use option `-S` to connect with SSL, or use option `-O` to use old SSL v2 and v3.

```sh
hydra -l username -p password -S example.com ftp
```

### Attack With Specified Port

```sh
hydra -l username -p password -s 8080 example.com http
```

### Try Password First / Try Username First

By default, Hydra follows a sequential approach, attempting all passwords for one username before moving on to the next username. However, by enabling the option `-u`, Hydra loops through the passwords, trying the first password on all usernames and then proceeding to the next password in a similar manner.

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -P pws.txt -u example.com ftp
```

### Multiple Servers

server.txt:

```
example.com
testphp.vulnweb.com
free-ftp.com
...
```

```sh
hydra -l username -p password -M server.txt example.com ftp
```

### Output to Files

Use option `-o` to specify the output file. And you can use the option `-b` to specify the format of output, the available formats are: `text`, `json`, and `jsonv1`.

```sh
hydra -l username -p password -o result -b json example.com ftp
```

### Number of Connections

Use option `-t` to specify how many connections will run in parallel.

```sh
hydra -l username -p password -t 100 example.com ftp
```

### Delay Between Each Request

Use option `-W` to specify the delay in seconds between each request a task send.

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -P pws.txt -W 10 example.com ftp
```

And use option `-c` to specify the wait time in seconds per login attempt over all threads.

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -P pws.txt -c 10 example.com ftp
```

### Resume Attacks

The task status will be stored in `./hydra.restore`, if you abort the Hydra and want to resume the attack, use option `-R`.

```sh
hydra -L users.txt -P pws.txt -R example.com ftp
```

## Examples

### E-Mail Brute Force

Use `passwords.txt` list to try the password for `admin@example.com`, using port 465 and SSL, the SMTP server is `smtp.example.com`.

```sh
hydra -l admin@example.com -P passwords.txt -s 465 -S smtp.example.com smtp
```

### Configuration Options

```
NAME
    hydra - a very fast network logon cracker which supports many different services

SYNOPSIS
    hydra [options] server service

DESCRIPTION
    server
        A target to attack, can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address or DNS name.

    service
        A service to attack, see the list of protocols available.

OPTIONS

    -R
        Restore a previously aborted session. Requires a hydra.restore file was written. Options are restored, but can be changed by setting them after -R on the command line.

    -S
        Connect via SSL.

    -O
        Use old SSL v2 and v3.

    -s port
        If the service is on a different default port, define it here.

    -l login
        Or -L FILE login with login name, or load several logins from FILE.

    -p password
        Or -P FILE try password password, or load several passwords from FILE.

    -x min:max:charset
        Generate passwords from min to max length. charset can contain 1 for numbers, a for lowcase and A for upcase characters.

    -y
        Disable use of symbols in -x bruteforce, see above.

    -e
        NSR additional checks, "n" for null password, "s" try login as pass, "r" try the reverse login as pass.

    -C file
        Colon separated "login:pass" format, instead of -L/-P options.

    -u
        By default Hydra checks all passwords for one login and then tries the next login. This option loops around the passwords, so the first password is tried on all logins, then the next password.

    -f
        Exit after the first found login/password pair (per host if -M).

    -F
        Exit after the first found login/password pair for any host (for usage with -M).

    -M file
        Server list for parallel attacks, one entry per line.

    -o file
        Write found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout.

    -b format
        Specify the format for the -o FILE: text, json, jsonv1 (default text).

    -t tasks
        Run TASKS number of connects in parallel (default 16).

    -m options
        Module specific options. See hydra -U <module> what options are available.

    -w time
        Defines the max wait time in seconds for responses (default 32).

    -W time
        Defines a wait time between each connection a task performs. This usually only makes sense if a low task number is used (.e.g -t 1).

    -c time
        The wait time in seconds per login attempt over all threads (-t 1 is recommended). This usually only makes sense if a low task number is used (.e.g -t 1).

    -4 / -6
        Prefer IPv4 (default) or IPv6 addresses.

    -v / -V
        Verbose mode / show login+pass combination for each attempt.

    -d
        Debug mode.

    -I
        Ignore an existing restore file (don't wait 10 seconds).

    -h, --help
        Show summary of options.
```
