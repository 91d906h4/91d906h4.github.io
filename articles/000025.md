## Introduction

The Smurf Attack is a type of network-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that targets the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and exploits the characteristics of broadcast networks. The attack involves flooding a victim's network with a large volume of ICMP echo request (ping) packets. It takes advantage of the broadcast address functionality in network protocols, which allows a single packet to be sent to all devices on a network simultaneously.

There is another type of attack named Fraggle Attack. The basic idea of Fraggle Attack is similar to Smurf Attack, but Fraggle Attack send UDP packets, and Smurf Attack send ICMP packet.

## How Smurf Attack Works?

### 1. IP Address Spoofing

The attacker spoofs the source IP address of the ICMP echo request packets to match the victim's IP address. This makes it appear as if the victim is sending the requests.

### 2. Identifying a Broadcast Network
The attacker identifies a network that allows broadcast traffic, such as an older Ethernet network or an improperly configured network. In these networks, a packet sent to the broadcast address is delivered to all devices on the network.

### 3. Broadcasting ICMP Echo Requests
The attacker sends a large number of ICMP echo request packets to the network's broadcast address. These packets are typically small in size.

### 4. Network Devices Respond
All devices on the network that receive the spoofed ICMP echo request packets respond by sending ICMP echo replies to the victim's IP address. This includes devices that should not be responding to broadcast requests.

### 5. Traffic Amplification
The ICMP echo replies sent by the network devices are often larger in size than the original ICMP echo requests. This amplifies the volume of traffic sent to the victim's network, as each reply can be significantly larger.

### 6. Overwhelming the Victim
With numerous ICMP echo replies being sent to the victim's IP address, the victim's network becomes inundated with traffic. The sheer volume of incoming traffic can overwhelm the victim's network resources, causing a degradation in performance or even a complete loss of connectivity.

## How to Privent Smurf Attack?

### Disable IP-directed broadcasts

By disabling IP directed broadcasts at the network level, you can prevent the use of the network's broadcast address for amplifying the attack. This can be done by configuring network devices to drop or ignore packets with a destination IP address of the broadcast address.

### Enable ingress filtering

Implement ingress filtering at network boundaries to block or filter traffic with source IP addresses that are not within the valid range of the network.

### Network Segmentation

Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a Smurf attack. By dividing your network into smaller segments, you can contain the attack to a specific segment and prevent it from affecting the entire network.

## How to Implement Smurf Attack?

`hping3` is a very good tool to implement the Smurf Attack. Here's a simple way to launch a Smurf Attack with `hping3`.

```sh
hping3 -a 192.168.0.100 --flood -1 255.255.255.255
```

1. Option `-a` is used to spoof the IP address. The address `192.168.0.100` is the IP of victim machine.
2. Option `--flood` tells `hping3` to send ICMP packets as fast as possible.
3. Option `-1` tells `hping3` to send the ICMP packets.
4. And the address `255.255.255.255` is the broadcast address that used to send broadcast to every machines on the network.

### How to Implement Fraggle Attack?

To launch a Fraggle Attack, just to change the option `-1` to `-2` to send the UDP packets.

```sh
hping3 -a 192.168.0.100 --flood -2 255.255.255.255
```
