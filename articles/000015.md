## Introduction

Dirb is a web content scanning tool that stands for "Directory Buster." It is a widely used open-source tool for discovering hidden directories and files on web servers. Dirb helps in the process of web application enumeration, assisting penetration testers and security analysts in identifying potential areas of vulnerability.

Dirb works by performing brute-force directory and file discovery. It does this by sending HTTP requests to a target web server and analyzing the server's responses. By systematically trying different directory and file names, Dirb attempts to uncover hidden content that may not be readily accessible through normal browsing or navigation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```sh
dirb https://example.com
```

### Case-Insensitive Searches

Use option `-i` to do case-insensitive search. With this option enabled, Dirb won't search the directory `/Admin` again if `/admin` not found.

```sh
dirb https://example.com -i
```

### Ignore HTTP Code

Use option `-N` to ignore specified HTTP code. You can only specify one code in one time.

```sh
dirb https://example.com -N 403
```

### Search with Customized Extension

Use option `-X` to amplify search with specified extensions.

For example, with the following command, Dirb will enumerating directory with extension .php and .txt.

```sh
dirb https://example.com -X .php,.txt
```

```
---- Scanning URL: https://example.com ----
...
Testing: https://example.com/~admin.php
Testing: https://example.com/~admin.txt
Testing: https://example.com/~Admin.php
Testing: https://example.com/~Admin.txt
...
```

Or you can use option `-x` to specify the file of extesion list.

ext.txt:

```
.php
.txt
```

```sh
dirb https://example.com -x ext.txt
```

### Send Request with Delay

With option `-z` ebabled, Dirb will delay n milliseconds between each request sent.

```sh
dirb https://example.com -z 100
```
