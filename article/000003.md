## Introduction

In this semester, we have a course called "System Softrware", this is the first time I was exposed to assmbly language. I was so excited because I could write the basic assembly language. And then I think, Why don't I make an assmbly language myself!<br />
Here's the beginning of HIC.

<!-------------------->

## HIC and the "Executer"

To create a real assembly language, we may need to design a new CPU or machine, that's a quite difficult task. So, what we are going to do is to make an "executer" to simulate how a real computer works.<br />
This executer will parse and run our assembly language named "HIC". (This name is from "SIC/EX" in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/System-Software-Introduction-Systems-Programming/dp/0201423006" target="_blank">System Software</a>.)

First, we need to design the syntax of HIC. Like most assembly language, HIC needs some instructions like `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `JLT`, etc. To keep our assembly simple, we just use the basic instructions:

```
VAL $a <value>     # Assign $a = <value>

ADD $a $b          # Assign $a = $a + $b
SUB $a $b
MUL $a $b
DIV $a $b

JEQ $a $b <label> # Jump to <label> if $a == $b
JNQ $a $b <label>
JLT $a $b <label>
JLE $a $b <label>

LAB <label>        # Assign a label
MSG $a             # Print value of $a on the screen
IPT $a             # Input a value and assign $a = input value
END                # End the program
```

Here are the all instructions in HIC.<br />
For example, if you want to write a loop to add 1 to 10 numbers and print the result, you can do this with the following HIC code:

```
# Assign $a and $b
VAL $a 1
VAL $b 1

# Assign the label
LAB SUM

ADD $a $b
ADD $b 1

# If $b is less than 10, then jump to label "SUM"
JLT $b 10 SUM

# Print the result
MSG $a
```

Now, our HIC assembly language is almost done. The next step is to parse each line in HIC file and execute them.

What the executer does is just to read the instructions line by line and execute immediatly. This is quite simple, for example, if we have the instruction:

```
VAL $a 10
```

We just need a Python dict and say that, the value of key $a is an integer 10.<br />
Or:

```
ADD $a 1
```

In this case, we need to get the value of $a in a python dict and add 10 to it, then save the new value back to the dict.

Follow this concept, we can write the executer. (You can find the whole source of executer on my <a href="https://github.com/91d906h4/HIC/blob/master/v3/executer%20v3.py" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.)

<!-------------------->

## HyLang

Now we have the executer to simulate the executoin of assembly, the next step is to design a compiler which will translate our high-level programming language into HIC.

The basic concept of HyLang compiler is as same as the executer. Let's see some examples:

```
var a = 10;
var b = 'Hello!';
```

This is similar to the instruction `VAL` in HIC. So, we can translate them into:

```
VAL $a 10
VAL $b 'Hello!'
```

But how about the for-loop? Fist, we need to design a for-loop in HyLang:

```
for(var i = 1, i < 10, i += 1){
    print(i);
}
```

As you can see, the structure of for-loop is:

```
for(<initialization of the starting value>, <stopping condition>, <what to do in the end of each loop>){...}
```

And the HIC code will be:

```
VAL $i 1 # <initialization of the starting value>

LAB FOR_LOOP # Assign a label

MSG $i # Something to do in the loop

ADD $i 1 # <what to do in the end of each loop>

JLT $i 10 FOR_LOOP # <stopping condition>
```

There's a pattern to follow to translate the high-level programming language into assmebly language.<br />
And we will not talk too many details about how to do that. (You can see the details on my <a href="https://github.com/91d906h4/HIC/blob/master/v3/assembler%20v3.py" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.)

## Syntax

### Comment

Like Python, HyLang use the `#` to comment the code.

```
# This is a comment is HyLang.
```

### Variables

There are four types (integer, string, float, and list) in HyLang. You can use the keyword `var` to declare a new variable.

```
var name = '91d906h4';
var age = 20;
var f = 10.5;
var new_f = f;
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### If Else

There is no difference in `if`, `else` statement between HyLang and other programming languages. You can use `if`, `else` combination or just one `if`.

```
# Example 1

var time = 19;

if(time >= 18){
    print('こんばんは！');
}
else{
    print('こんにちは！');
}

# Output:
# こんばんは！
```

```
# Example 2

input(name);

if(name == '91d906h4'){
    print('わ、私、ですか...');
}
```

### For Loop

In HyLang, the conditions of for loop in split by a `,` (comma), not by a `;` (semicolon).

```
for(var i = 0, i <= 10, i += 1){
    print(i);
}

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# .
# .
# .
# 10
```

### Cal

In HyLang, any types of operation must start with `cal` keyword. And there can only be at most one operator in a `col` statement.

```
# Example 1

var hoge = 1;
cal hoge = hoge + 1;
print(hoge);

# Output:
# 2
```

```
# Example 2

var fuga = 'Hello';
cal fuga = fuga + ' World!';
print(fuga);

# Output:
# Hello World!
```

### While Loop

```
var counter = 1;

while(counter < 10){
    cal counter = counter * 2;
    print(counter);
}

# Output:
# 2
# 4
# 8
# 16
```

### Input

You can use `input()` function to get the input from the user.

```
var greeting = 'Hello! ';
input(name);
cal greeting += name;
print(greeting);

# Input:
# John

# Output:
# Hello! John
```
